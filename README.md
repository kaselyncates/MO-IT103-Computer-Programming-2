# MotorPH Employee Management Application

This is a **Java-based GUI application** developed for the **MotorPH Employee Management System**. It provides basic functionalities such as **user login** and **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** for employee records using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Java Swing**.

> ⚠️ Note: This version uses **CSV files** for data storage and is intended for educational purposes. In future enhancements (Object-Oriented Programming course), this project will be expanded into a full **MotorPH Payroll System**.
